## Why do this whole wrapperclass-thing? ##
Look at the following code (it's only getting executed once!):

_W.Cast(target);
_Q.Cast(target);

There are champions where both skills are getting cast (Ekko), and some where only the first one is getting cast (Brand) (also depends on the skills). 
This mostly doesn't matter if the code getts called every tick, as Q will eventually also get used, but what if you have this code in your Gapcloser logic?
(The gapcloser event gets called multiple times, but only as long as the gapcloser is in the gapcloser spell)
If this code was in the gapcloser logic and e has a high cast time and the enemy a short gapcloser, q would never execute! 
Sometimes on some champs, Q will even get cast before W. This behaviour also changed with a patch once. The Skill + ComboSystem classes
automatically create a relyable environment, because the order when which skills are cast is controlled by the ComboSystem. It also enables you
to implement features faster, as some general features like Menu + logic for things like Manamanger, hitchance, Enabled/Disabled and others are automatically implemented.


What is a ...
*	Skill: a class containing the logic for a specific spell. For example your Q
*	ComboProvider: The class managing the skills, also able to generate menus, passes Interrupter and gapcloser events to the skills, ...

Skill:
*	Each skill has it's own logic. Create a class for each skill and derive it from Commons.ComboSystem.Skill
	(It's a class derived from the LeagueSharp.Common.Spell that automatically implements Menu + logic for things like Manamanger, hitchance,
	Enabled/Disabled skills and supports things like QueuedCasts)
*	You may want to set OnlyUpdateIfTargetValid, OnlyUpdateIfCastable or things like SetSkillshot(...) in the constructor
*	Implement the abstract stuffs. In GetPriority return the skill priority. Skills with a higher priority are getting called first.
	You could also add logic to dynamically return a different priority in a different sitation
*	In the Execute method add logic to attack the given target. It will get called when Harassing or in Combo after automatically checking 
	ManaManager, Menu options and setting things like the MinHitchance
